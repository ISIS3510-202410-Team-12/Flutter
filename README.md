Welcome to the UniSchedule Flutter repository! This repository contains the implementation of the UniSchedule application in Dart using the Flutter framework. UniSchedule is a comprehensive scheduling app designed to streamline the organization of academic and personal schedules for students at Universidad de los Andes.

## Architecture Overview

The UniSchedule app follows a layered architecture pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns and promote modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The architecture consists of the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. This layer contains UI components such as widgets, screens, and layouts, organized within the `presentation` directory.

- **Application Layer**: Acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the domain layer. It orchestrates business logic and application workflows, coordinating the flow of data and operations. Providers for state management are defined in the `providers` directory, facilitating data sharing and management across the application.

- **Domain Layer**: Represents the core business logic and domain-specific entities, rules, and operations. Models representing various data entities and business rules are defined in the `models` directory.

- **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides access to external resources and services such as databases, APIs, and device features. Repository classes abstract data access and manipulation operations, encapsulating interactions with external data sources. These repositories are defined in the `repositories` directory.

## Directory Structure

The `lib` directory of this repository is organized into several subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose:

- `constants`: Contains constant values used throughout the application.
- `models`: Defines Dart classes representing data models used within the application.
- `presentation`: Houses UI-related files, including widgets, screens, and components responsible for rendering the user interface.
- `providers`: Contains files defining providers for state management using the Riverpod or Provider package.
- `repositories`: Includes classes responsible for abstracting data access and manipulation operations.
- `routes`: Defines the routing configuration of the application for navigation between different screens.
- `services`: Contains utility classes or service classes responsible for performing specific tasks or providing functionalities used across multiple parts of the application.

## Troubleshooting

We use files auto-generated by @riverpod and @freezer annotations. To build these files, run `flutter pub run build_runner build`

If the dependency `flutter_datetime_picker` throws `Error: 'DatePickerTheme' is imported from both ...`, follow these steps:

1. Go to the dependency's file that throws this error - in windows, a path similar to `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\hosted\pub.dev\flutter_datetime_picker-1.5.1\lib\flutter_datetime_picker.dart`)
2. Replace `import 'package:flutter_datetime_picker/src/datetime_picker_theme.dart` with `import 'package:flutter_datetime_picker/src/datetime_picker_theme.dart' as dpt`
3. Replace all references to `DatePickerTheme` in the file with `dpt.DatePickerTheme` with a code editor
